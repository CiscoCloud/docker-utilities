Utility Scripts to automate some of day 2 day docker tasks

a. Use the removeExitedContainers.sh to remove all the containers with the status = Exited

b. Use the loadDockerEnvForMac.sh to load the env of a particular machine. It takes the machin name as the first argument. Also to load it in the executing shell it should be used as "source loadDockerEnv.sh %machine-name%"
